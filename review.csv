handle-of-your-product,5,Outstanding Sound,curly9702,example@email.com," I must say these are outstanding slip-on mufflers. Great price, no backfire effect and sound very throaty. I read the comment related to your neighbors hating you..., and that is a true statement. Traffic will know you are around them. I have a 2020 Indian Springfield so they fit perfect on my factory pipes. Save yourself money on buying too expensive name brand pipes, performance air filter and then doing ECU flash. These Sharkroad 4"" Slip-on Mufflers will do the same at a fraction of the cost.",,2020-03-15 0:00:00,,US,enable,0

handle-of-your-product,5,Sharkroad SlipOns for Indian Chieftain are AWESOME!!!!,Chris,example@email.com,"Under $300 and sound great, easy install. Every bit as good as Tab Performance with zombie baffles. These bad boys are loud, but not horrible at highway speeds.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HCGD1iO+L._SL1000_.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4w3SZt+L._SL1000_.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kdztjwrcL._SL1000_.jpg",2020-09-30 0:00:00,,US,enable,0
handle-of-your-product,5,Great Sounding Pipes,Rico Suave,example@email.com,Good price for a good product. I have to say these are obnoxiously loud because I've removed my catalytic converter. But I still like them. I hope they stay looking great. Just to be on the safe side I have wiped them down with Mother's chrome cleaner. I'll update my review after a few miles.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B7B+JaEeL._SL1000_.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fdT1qpebL._SL1000_.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qtuFIcYUL._SL1000_.jpg",2020-10-01 0:00:00,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/c31b7163-75ec-4a30-ac1e-5bd9d215c272._CR0,0,499,499_SX48_.jpg",US,enable,0
handle-of-your-product,5,Loud! Good Quality,Robert Pickelsimer,example@email.com,The no baffle design is great for adding baffles of your choice! I opted for Thunder Monster Baffles by Big City Thunder. Quality is very good!,,2020-10-07 0:00:00,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/4eef14fe-a03a-4acb-9049-143e28f2c82f._CR84,0,332,332_SX48_.jpg",US,enable,0
handle-of-your-product,5,Great sounding.,Dustin,example@email.com,Love these pipes on 2019 Indian Chieftain. I will no longer be made fun of for having the quiet bike anymore. All my buddies I ride with are kicking themselves for spending way more than I did on my pipes. Well worth the money.,,2021-01-27 0:00:00,,US,enable,0
handle-of-your-product,5,Good setup for the price!,Jacob,example@email.com," 2017 indian Springfield, fit and finish were good and sounds was as expected based on seller's description.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B12oF10hJpS._SL1000_.jpg,2021-01-28 0:00:00,,US,enable,0
handle-of-your-product,5,Works for the Indian Challenger!,Calvin Craner,example@email.com," I bought the black pipes for the Indian Challenger base model. I painted the exhaust shields a matte black earlier but I will be having them ceramic coated instead which will be a more satin black which should make the pipes and shields match closely. I assume chrome for the limited and base model Challenger will look the same. I really like how Shark Road provided different bolts even though the stock ones work, the upper mounting bolt is a tight fit with a ratchet but with the provided bolts and washers I was able to reinstall them much easier. The pipes I purchased are non baffled, it uses the step down method inside. Video note, sound is from inside my shop which can ""change"" the sound a little. I was planning on purchasing and welding in baffles but I will hold off till I put miles on the bike as I like the sound right now. If you want loud this will do it. If you want rumble, this will do it. The pipes are slightly longer than stock, as long as you aren't planning on wheelies they are just fine! The bag supports line up perfectly with the rubber cushions under the bags and the tip design is a great addition to the look. I haven't verified but I think the tips could be rotated 180 and have an opposite slope that matches the stock slash cut look. If you are looking for a good deal on a set of pipes these are your ticket.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C11ne4-n0YS._SL1000_.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1AqbR8bZAS._SL1000_.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1ebTKgtsiS._SL1000_.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1g9v81zYIS._SL1000_.jpg",2021-03-09 0:00:00,,US,enable,0
